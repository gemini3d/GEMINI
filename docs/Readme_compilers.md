# Fortran 2008 compilers

Modern Fortran compilers are widely and freely available.
If you don't already have a Fortran compiler, it's straightforward to install.
GEMINI requires a Fortran compiler that handles Fortran 2008 syntax including

* submodule
* block

Most currently maintained Fortran compilers can do this.
Gfortran and Intel Fortran are two compilers known to work easily with GEMINI.
Here are details on a few Fortran compilers suitable for Gemini.

## Gfortran

Gfortran &ge; 6 has adequate Fortran 2008 support for Gemini.
Here are a few ways to get Gfortran on your computer:

### MacOS Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
is a very popular development repository for MacOS.
Installing the latest GCC including Gfortran is simply:

```sh
brew install gcc
```

Install everything needed for Gemini like:

```sh
brew install cmake gcc hdf5 openmpi lapack scalapack
```

If using Homebrew, be sure Homebrew's GCC is used instead of AppleClang or other non-Homebrew compilers so that the Homebrew library ABIs match the compiler ABI.

```sh
FC=gfortran-9 CC=gcc-9 cmake -B build
```

If you need to specify MPI compiler wrappers, do like:

```sh
cmake -B build -DMPI_ROOT=~/lib_gcc/openmpi-3.1.4
```

### Linux

Currently supported versions of Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Windows Subsystem for Linux generally have Gfortran &ge; 6 available.
For CentOS, typical HPC will have the ability to switch to a recent GCC version--ask your HPC IT staff.

* Ubuntu / Debian / Windows Subsystem for Linux: `apt install gfortran`
* CentOS: `yum install gcc-gfortran`

### Windows

In general for Fortran development on Windows,
[MSYS2](https://www.scivision.dev/install-msys2-windows/)
provides a comprehensive development solution.
From the MSYS2 terminal, install GCC and Gfortran by:

```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-fortran
```

other Gemini-required libraries are obtained by:

```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-hdf5
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-lapack
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-scalapack
```

## Intel Fortran

Intel compilers are available at no-cost for academic instruction and open-source projects.
You need to have
[Intel Parallel Studio XE](https://software.intel.com/en-us/parallel-studio-xe)
that includes IntelMPI, BLACS and SCALAPACK.
Intel Fortran &ge; 19.1 / Parallel Studio &ge; 2020 are generally targeted for Gemini support.

We regularly use the latest release Intel compilers on Linux and Windows.
MacOS with Intel compiler hasn't been tried--let us know.

### Intel MKL with Gfortran

Intel MKL with Gfortran should work, let us know if there's an issue.
