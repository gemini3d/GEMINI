  !SHALL WE ALSO PRECOMPUTE SOME OF THE PRODUCTS FOR ADVECTION?

  !SIZE INFORMATION
  integer :: lx1,lx2,lx3,lx2all,lx3all    !for program units that may not be able to access module globals

  !UNIT VECTORS - NO ONE NEEDS A FULL GRID COPY OF THESE, I BELIEVE
  real(wp), dimension(:,:,:,:), allocatable :: e1,e2,e3     !unit vectors in curvilinear space (in cartesian components)
  real(wp), dimension(:,:,:,:), allocatable :: er,etheta,ephi    !spherical unit vectors (in cartesian components)

  !GEOMAGNETIC GRID DATA
  real(wp), dimension(:,:,:), allocatable :: r,theta,phi    !may be used in the interpolation of neutral perturbations

  !FULL-GRID GEOMAGNETIC INFORMATION - USED BY ROOT IN INTERPOLATING ELECTRIC FIELD FILE INPUT
  real(wp), dimension(:,:,:), allocatable :: rall,thetaall,phiall

  !GEOGRAPHIC DATA
  real(wp), dimension(:,:,:), allocatable :: glat,glon,alt

  !MAGNETIC FIELD - THIS IS  PART OF THE GRID SINCE THE COORDINATE SYSTEM USED IS BASED ON THE MAGNETIC FIELD
  real(wp), dimension(:,:,:), allocatable :: Bmag
  real(wp), dimension(:,:), allocatable :: I

  !DEFINE POINTS TO EXCLUDE FROM NUMERICAL SOLVES?
  real(wp), dimension(:,:,:), allocatable :: nullpts   !this could be a logical but I'm going to treat it as real*8
  integer :: lnull                                    !length of null point index array
  integer, dimension(:,:), allocatable :: inull

  !DIFFERENTIAL LENGTH ELEMENTS NEEDED TO COMPUTE COURANT NUMBERS
  real(wp), dimension(:,:,:), allocatable :: dl1i,dl2i,dl3i

  !A FLAG FOR INDICATING WHETHER OR NOT PERIODIC
  logical :: flagper
